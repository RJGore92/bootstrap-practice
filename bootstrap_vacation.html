        </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
          <p>There are several points in which you can access a plane to the Isles, though to do so, there are several transfer points on outlying islands.  Mystics from the main islands guard these transfer points and carry rune keys to open the gateways to the "other side" where the magic domain of our island network hides.  Once crossed over, there will be warded planes ready to transfer incoming and outgoing guests to the main islands where the resort is built upon, the largest island having its own runway for our transport planes to come in to deliver guests to and from our resort.  Our main resort building is just a short ride northwest of the runway, easily identifiable by the mystic conduit spire that overlooks most of the runway and the ocean.</p>

            <p>"I was completely thrown for a loop upon visiting these islands for the first time.  Beasts you could only dream about in fiction, mystic arts and ecosystems that you could imagine in fantasy and dreams, and more, all here on this resort!  I want to learn more from the teachers of the arcane in future visits, and share my learnings with those back home."</p>

            <p>"There is so much that I could share about these islands that the resort brochure barely even touches or even does justice to.  Magics of many different realms of fantasy made real on the Isles, from harnessing nature to powerful words of the arcane and even powers of healing light made manifest by the lands and the masters there, just to name a few.  I learned so much over several visits, and I hope to return to further my experiences and become a master of magic in the mainland, too.  Well recommended for anyone looking to experience things beyond this world."</p>

            <p>"My sister, being an experienced magician, first heard of this resort from a recommendation through a few friends, and while she and I were both skeptical of it at first, we both did our research and eventually decided to arrange a family visit.  Before we landed on the main island's runway, we looked out the window and could see from a distance just how different the land was, and it looked even better when we had stepped off the plane to observe the wildlife.  It was like we stepped completely away from reality and into a book of fairy tales, and the days we spent there only further reinforced these thoughts and opinions, teaching me and my sister arts of the arcane that would be beyond any magic show act back home.<br>
            It was so cool getting to learn from the island's masters and become aspirants and apprentices to the island's teachers.  We even got to keep a few copies of the mystic tomes for practice back home.  Definitely will come again to study more in the future and also enjoy the resort in its entirety."</p>
